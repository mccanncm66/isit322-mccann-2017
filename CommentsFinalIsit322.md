# Comments Final

Comments on Final.

You are an excellent student.

- Understanding: Very good
- Discipline, enthusiasm, attitude: Excellent

You earned an A for the quarter.

## GitExplorer

- Compiles and runs with concurrency from GitExplorer directory
- Runs without significant warnings or errors
- Loads from MongoDB

## Features that work

- Get User info
  - Bonus: Allows user to pick from hardcoded list of repos
- Create Gist
- List Gists
  - Delete Gist
- Use one other feature of the Git API
- Redux

You did an okay job on the simple redux assignment, but not as well on integrating **Redux** into GitExplorer. It is there in **SmallNumbers**, but not in all the places it should be.

## Micro Services

You:

- Started at least two micro services with concurrently
- Use the database from a micro service

## Heroku

Your Heroku app duplicates the experience I have running your your app locally. I can access all the features of the app and they run without warning or error.

## Native

- It compiles and runs
- I can load it on my phone
- It queries at least one service from your application

Yeah. GetUser works on my phone!

## Tests

Basic stats reported after run all:

```
Test Suites: 5 failed, 3 passed, 8 total
Tests:       116 failed, 17 passed, 133 total
```

I understand that this just fell behind as we approached the final and did more refactoring. Perhaps school is just the wrong place to teach unit tests. Maybe you have to be on production system before one can see why they are worth maintaining.
