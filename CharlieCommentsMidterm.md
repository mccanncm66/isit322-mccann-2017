# Comments Midterm Isit322 2017

This document contains Charlie's comments on your Isit322 2017 Midterm.

This is excellent. You fulfill all the requirements, nail the tests, and run without error. This is very nice work Caleb.

It's been great watching you work over the last few quarters. You started out not knowing a lot about this kind of development, but caught on fast, and now you are well ahead of most in the class. I admire your passion, discipline and persistence.

And thanks. I didn't know about **mz/fs**. I'll have to start using that or at least understanding it better. It has not been updated in awhile. I'm not sure what is in the latest builds of node. But the more es6 we can use the better, given the nice changes they have pushed.

## Basics

Your application has a styled menu and supports component switching. You included the following menu items:

- **Home**
- **GetFoo**
- **SmallNumbers**

## Additional Requests

- You made at least two more requests of the GitHub API
- You Included the results of these requests in the menu
- Your app switches between your Git request views

## Tests and Polish

- You have 131 test in at 7 test suits.
- JSCS is available and some major files in the project pass JSCS tests. There are a few warnings though, such as punctuator and double quotes.
- Your code runs without warnings and errors.
- Despite the JSCS errors, you code is mostly very clean.
- There are a few lines of dead code in some files. Just delete it and depend on Git to get it back if needed, or else create a file called **deadcode.js** and put it there.

## Extra Credit

- Your **git-convert** program spits out field definition files. Very nice.

Perhaps have used stringify so it is easier to read:

```javascript
console.log(JSON.stringify(fieldDefinition, null, 4));
```
